Today I bring you a work in progress script for those that need help when first join your FiveM server. It's operated off a simple /help command, and can be configured to show any message you want. If you have any questions or suggestions, feel free to let me know!

No Requirments in your FiveM Server. This is a standalone script. Just drag the Help-Command folder into your server resources, and add to your server.cfg

For my Discord Server, we have a #Help cahnnel and a 'Support' Role for support members. This command just notifys poeple to join our discord and ping the Support Role so someone can help them out. If you dont want to set that up, change the msg("YOUR TEXT HERE") and replace the text. If you only want one message line, just delete the second line.

Command: /help

Example Message Shown: "Server Discord: https://discord.gg/G6MXRY7m9C"
